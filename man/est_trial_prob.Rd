\usage{
est_trial_prob(d, ppos_q = 0.95, ppos_sim = 1000,
  post_method = "approx", a1 = 1, b1 = 1, a2 = 1, b2 = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{The Trial data}

\item{ppos_q}{The vector of cut-points to consider}

\item{ppos_sim}{Number of simulations from posterior predictive to use in PPoS(q) calculation}

\item{post_method}{Method used to calculate P(X > Y + delta), one of `exact` (integration), `approx` (normal), `sim` (monte carlo)}

\item{a1}{Prior shape for treatment 1}

\item{b1}{Prior scale for treatment 1}

\item{a2}{Prior shape for treatment 2}

\item{b2}{Prior scale for treatment 2}
}
\value{
Updates `d` inplace but also returns the updated `d`
